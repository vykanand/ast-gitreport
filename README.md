# NodeJS GIT Utilites for Sr dev leads

This project contains tools for analyzing and reporting on Git repositories and codebases.

## Project Files

* **`file_traverser.js`**:  Likely traverses files in a directory.
* **`generatorAI.js`**: Potentially uses Google's Generative AI API.
* **`gitreport-multi.js`**:  Probably generates reports for multiple Git repositories.
* **`gitreport.js`**: Generates reports for a single Git repository.
* **`hello.go`**: A simple Go program (likely for testing or demonstration).
* **`multirepo-report.html`**:  An HTML file to display multi-repo reports.
* **`package.json`**: Project dependencies and scripts.
* **`package-lock.json`**: Locked dependency versions.
* **`project_structure.json`**:  (Purpose unknown without further inspection).
* **`repoclone.js`**:  Likely clones Git repositories.
* **`ast-gitreport/`**:  (Directory appears empty based on previous tool use).


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-simple-ast`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

The specific usage of each script will depend on its implementation.  The following are educated guesses and may require adjustments.

* **`file_traverser.js`**:  Likely requires a directory path as an argument.  Example: `node file_traverser.js /path/to/directory`
* **`generatorAI.js`**:  Likely requires API keys and prompts as arguments.  Refer to the Google Generative AI API documentation for details.
* **`gitreport-multi.js`**:  Edit you GIT Repo folder in code and then run this command.  Example: `node gitreport-multi.js` you will get report in html format in the root folder.
* **`gitreport.js`**:  Likely takes a repository URL or path as an argument.  Example: `node gitreport.js /path/to/repo`
* **`hello.go`**:  Run using the Go compiler: `go run hello.go`
* **`repoclone.js`**:  Likely takes a repository URL as an argument.  Example: `node repoclone.js <repository_url>`

This README will be updated with more detailed instructions as the project develops.
