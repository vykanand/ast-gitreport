# ENTERPRISE AI TOOLS SUITE

# TODO TASKS For this project:
1. Multi repo Dependency analysis
2. Multi repo file traverse
3. Multi repo API endpoints collect and analyse
# NodeJS GIT Utilites for Managing Dev Teams

This project contains tools for analyzing and reporting on Git repositories and codebases.

## Project Files

* **`file_traverser.js`**: This script traverses a given directory, extracts code elements (classes and functions) from supported file types (`.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.php`), builds a folder tree structure representing the directory's contents, and generates an AI prompt containing this information.  This prompt is designed to be used with a large language model (LLM) to analyze the project's architecture, design patterns, and potential best practices violations. The script then uses the LLM to provide insights and suggestions for improvement.  It requires a directory path as an argument. Example: `node file_traverser.js /path/to/directory`
* **`generatorAI.js`**: Common Google's Generative AI Library for the project to process prompts and provide analysis.Further details require inspecting the code.
* **`gitreport-multi.js`**:  Probably generates reports for multiple Git repositories.  Further details require inspecting the code.
* **`gitreport.js`**: Generates reports for a single Git repository. Further details require inspecting the code.
* **`hello.go`**: A simple Go program (likely for testing or demonstration). Further details require inspecting the code.
* **`multirepo-report.html`**:  An HTML file to display multi-repo reports.  Further details require inspecting the code.
* **`package.json`**: Project dependencies and scripts.
* **`project_structure.json`**: This file stores the project structure generated by `file_traverser.js`.
* **`repoclone.js`**:  Likely clones Git repositories. Further details require inspecting the code.
* **`ast-gitreport/`**: This directory appears to be empty.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-simple-ast`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

The specific usage of each script will depend on its implementation.  The following are educated guesses and may require adjustments.

* **`file_traverser.js`**: This script traverses a given directory, extracts code elements (classes and functions) from supported file types (`.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.php`), builds a folder tree structure representing the directory's contents, and generates an AI prompt containing this information.  This prompt is designed to be used with a large language model (LLM) to analyze the project's architecture, design patterns, and potential best practices violations. The script then uses the LLM to provide insights and suggestions for improvement.  It requires a directory path as an argument. Example: `node file_traverser.js /path/to/directory`
* **`generatorAI.js`**:  Likely requires API keys and prompts as arguments.  Refer to the Google Generative AI API documentation for details.
* **`gitreport-multi.js`**:  Probably takes a list of repository URLs or paths as arguments.  Example: `node gitreport-multi.js repo1 repo2 repo3`
* **`gitreport.js`**:  Likely takes a repository URL or path as an argument.  Example: `node gitreport.js /path/to/repo`
* **`hello.go`**:  Run using the Go compiler: `go run hello.go`
* **`repoclone.js`**:  Likely takes a repository URL as an argument.  Example: `node repoclone.js <repository_url>`

## Future Improvements

A more in-depth analysis of each file's functionality will be added in a future update.  This will require a more thorough code review and testing of each script.

This README will be updated with more detailed instructions as the project develops.

PS - We are working on a new version of this project.
